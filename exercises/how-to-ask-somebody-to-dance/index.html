      <ul>
  <li>Emphasize respect and consent throughout this exercise, especially around getting rejected for a dance.  Remind students that there are myriad reasons why the person they asked might not have wanted to dance, that they shouldn’t take it personally, and that <em>nobody</em> owes anybody a dance.</li>
  <li>You may need to modify the exercise slightly depending on your local scene’s ettiquette about dancing with person B after you’ve rejected person A.  In some scenes it’s totally fine, in others it’s extremely rude.</li>
  <li>Do all practice in both directions (i.e. side A ask side B, then side B ask side A).  Start with the bigger half asking the smaller half so people don’t feel immediately left out.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="exercise">Exercise</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Split students in half.  Get half on one side of the room and half on the other.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before we do anything else, we’re going to learn how to ask somebody to dance.  It’s harder than it seems, so pay attention.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="the-three-rules-of-asking-somebody-to-dance">The Three Rules of Asking Somebody to Dance</h4>

<p>Introduce the Three Rules of asking somebody to dance.  Demonstrate a slight exaggeration of failing each rule with your partner, then briefly discuss why the rule exists.</p>

<p>0. Smile!</p>

<p>It’s most effective to tie this one in with other discussions in the lesson about dancing primarily being about having fun.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’re having fun and smiling, your partner is more likely to be excited about dancing with you and more likely to have a great time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1. Make eye contact</p>

<p>Demo by coming up behind and asking over the shoulder.  It’s uncomfortable and students will immediately see that it’s uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Generally, if you can’t establish good eye contact with somebody before you ask them to dance, you probably shouldn’t ask them this time.  This could be because they’re busy with something (e.g. a conversation), distracted or deep in thought, or just don’t want to dance this song.</p>

<p>2. Extend your hand (foot, head, etc)</p>

<p>Demo by asking to dance while standing a little too far away with hands clasped behind back (or in pockets).</p>

<p>You should give the person you’re asking to dance an invitation to initiate a physical connection.  This one is a little flexible, since dancing with somebody doesn’t necessarily need to involve touching them, but it’s still best practice to ask with an open and inviting posture.</p>

<p>3. Verbalize the request–actually ask them to dance!</p>

<p>Demo by dramatically thrusting a hand out and giving a deep smouldering look.  Students will laugh.  Emphasize that some people actually do this because they think they look cool, but this is how they actually look.  Optionally, demo the grab-n-drag to bring up consent more explicitly.</p>

<p>This is the most important rule.  Not only is asking out loud polite, but it gives the person you’ve asked a chance to say no.  Yay, consent!</p>

<h4 id="practice">Practice</h4>

<p>[Call and response] the rules once or twice to cement them in the students’ minds.</p>

<p>Half the students ask the other half, and the askee will say ‘Yes!’.</p>

<p>Explain that now students are going to practice saying ‘no’ and being rejected.  Encourage students to give excuses if they’re true (about to go get water, bathroom, sitting out), but emphasize that they don’t need an excuse–a simple “No, thank you.” is fine–and to not lie about an excuse.  Discuss your scene’s ettiquette around saying ‘yes’ to person B after you’ve rejected person A.</p>

<p>Discuss the reasons somebody might say no: injury, not liking the song, not being in the mood, etc.  Encourage students to not take it personally if they get rejected for a dance, but just to brush it off and ask somebody else.</p>

<p>Half the students ask the other half.  The askee will say ‘No, thank you’ (or some variation) to the first ask and ‘yes’ to the second ask.</p>

<p>Before the second half of this last time practicing (i.e. when half B asks half A), you can tell students to bring the partner who says ‘yes’ to a spot in a circle around you and proceed with your lesson.</p>

<p>[Call and response] the rules one more time during the lesson, either after the last time practicing or at the end.</p>
