<dl>
  <dt>Axis</dt>
  <dd>Your solo axis runs vertically up from the center of your [floor contact area].  When you are ‘on axis’, your [center of mass] is colinear with your axis.  When you are ‘off axis’, your center of mass is somewhere other than your axis.  All solo spins must happen around this axis.  A couple dancing has a shared axis which runs vertically up from the center of the couple’s entire floor contact area.</dd>
  <dt>Balance</dt>
  <dd>By definition, you are balanced when your [center of mass] is anywhere above your [floor contact area].  To be more solidly balanced, either increase the size of your floor contact area, or lower your center of mass.</dd>
  <dt>Center of Mass</dt>
  <dd>Your center of mass is the average position of every bit of flesh, bone and muscle in your body.  Lifting your arms raises your center of mass.  Squatting lowers your center of mass.  Male bodies tend to have higher center of masses than female bodies.  Keep in mind that your center of mass doesn’t have to be inside your body.  For example, the center of mass of a donut is in the hole.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Core</p>

<p>Counterbalance</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Floor Contact Area</dt>
  <dd>The convex shape you’d get if you traced around the outside of every point of contact you have with the floor.  When you’re standing normally, your floor contact area is where your feet are touching the floor as well as everything in between your feet.  A dog’s floor contact area is the quadrilateral formed by where its paws touch the ground.  A ballet dancer’s floor contact area can be as small as two square inches when they go up on pointe.</dd>
  <dt>Inertia</dt>
  <dd>An object’s desire to not start moving.  Throwing a bowling ball is hard because it has a lot of inertia–it doesn’t want to start moving.  Your body naturally has a lot of inertia, which is why [tone] is required to move.  You can use tone to counteract inertia and make yourself feel easy to move–to be more responsive.</dd>
  <dt>Impedance</dt>
  <dd>The amount of change in [state] from a particular input.  Pushing on a wall doesn’t cause much change in its state (high impedance).  Pushing on a feather makes a big change in the feather’s state (low impedance).  Having higher [tone] generally increases your impedance–it makes you harder to move.  Having lower tone generally decreases your impedance–makes you easier to move.  You can also actively use tone to dramatically decrease impedance and become very responsive.</dd>
  <dt>Minimum Tone</dt>
  <dd>The minimum amount of [tone] your body requires to maintain a particular [state].  Standing up requires some minimum amount of tone, or else you’d fall over.  Our goal is generally to strive to find the minimum tone point for a particular state.</dd>
  <dt>Momentum</dt>
  <dd>An object’s desire to keep moving once already moving.  Catching a bowling ball is hard because it has a lot of momentum–it doesn’t want to stop moving.  The faster an object is moving, the more momentum it has.  Your body naturally has a lot of momentum, which is why [tone] is required to stop moving.  You can use tone to counteract momentum and make yourself feel easier to stop–to be more responsive.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Pocket (music)</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Posture</dt>
  <dd>Your posture is the literal physical position all the bits of your body are in at any given moment.  Good blues posture is a kind of combination of an athletic posture (feet shoulder width apart, relaxed knees, weight forward) and a classical dance posture (engaged core, relaxed shoulders, head up).</dd>
</dl>

<p>Pulse</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Spin</dt>
  <dd>A rotation around a stationary [axis].  You can be on- or off-axis, but it’s a spin either way if you are moving around your axis.</dd>
  <dt>State</dt>
  <dd>The full description both of your [posture] and how fast and in what direction each part of your body is moving.</dd>
  <dt>Tone</dt>
  <dd>Muscle engagement.  Your body almost always has some level of tone in your muscles–if nothing else then just to resist the pull of gravity.  Because of your [inertia] and [momentum], starting and stoping a movement always requires some [minimum tone].  The quicker the movement and the more of you that is moving, the more tone is required.  You can also use tone to change your [impedance]–higher tone means higher impedance, lower tone means lower impedance.</dd>
  <dt>Turn</dt>
  <dd>A [spin] where the [axis] is moving.  Generally the axis will be moving down a line, and you will be stepping along the line to execute the turn.</dd>
